#### This is my very first C++ project I wrote for my academic purposes.

##### In this program the user first give the source base and later give the value of the source base system and after that, the program will ask for the desired base of the number system to be converted.

##### I fix the ranges for the conversion to base 2-20. 
##### The user is prompted if entered information does not confine under the source base.

##### Anyone can updated the code according to his/her necessity
